# Please head to the report.pdf file to view a full documentation of the project.

Python version used in this project is:
Python 3.5

Modules and libraries used in this project are:

Keras - to implement our CNN 
opencv - for preprocessing 
numpy - for some preprocessing and neccessary operations

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can view the jupyter notebook i included for a step by step implementation, and of course you can still use the files there.

Run the Main.py file and pass it an arugment which is a picture and you will get the score of the possibiltiy of having a car in the picture you passed, you can use the pictures in the testImages folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The datasets i used are not included in the folder because the size was way too big, however i used two datasets which can be found here

First dataset for car images:

http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

Second dataset for non-car images:

http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/download/datasets.html



the second dataset for noncars images have some car pictures, since i used this dataset as examples of what a car does not look like for my model
i excluded every picture that has a car in it

Also please note that i didn't use the entire two datasets, i used around 4500 pictures from each dataset, which results in around 8900 pictures from 
both datasets.
